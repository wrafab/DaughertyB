<h1> Week 1</h1>
<h2>Learning HTML and First Day Challenges</h2>
<li>On the first day of school we were put in groups and were given challenges to complete. The first challenge we were given straws and tape and had to make a device to catch a golfball. The second challenge we were given newspapers and had to make as tall a tower as possible. In the following days we learned how to use HTML to make this website.</li>
