<h1> Week 4</h1>
<h2>Computer Controlled Cutting and Laser Cutting</h2>
<li>This week we learned how to laser cut. Our first Assignment was to make a clock. I designed a clock that had the score and date of when the cavs won the championship and a picture of Lebron Dunking. I designed the clock using Corel Draw. I then used Corel Draw to make a Pen box for my second assignment. The box was connected with living hinges.</li>
